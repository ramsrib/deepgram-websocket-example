# Deepgram WebSocket Example

This is a simple example of how to use the Deepgram WebSocket API to transcribe audio.

## Usage

```bash

- The `index.js` file uses the ws package to customize the WebSocket connection to transcribe audio.
- The `index-native.js` file uses the native WebSocket API to transcribe audio.
